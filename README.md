Warehouse Robot Generalization Project
Overview

This project demonstrates a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for warehouse automation, where a robot agent learns to navigate, pick up objects, and deliver them to a goal zone—using transferable skills that generalize across many warehouse layouts. We use Python Gymnasium for grid-based training, and Webots for realistic 3D robot simulation.
Key Features

    Simple RL warehouse environment (2D grid) with obstacles, packages, and delivery zones.

    Transfer learning: Train robot on multiple diverse warehouse layouts to avoid memorization.

    Generalization: Test the trained model on completely new, unseen layouts.

    Webots controller: Run the same RL logic on a realistic robot in a 3D physics simulation.

    Demo GIFs: Visualize robot performance on different layouts.

    Modular & extensible: Easily customize environment size, layouts, and agent logic.
